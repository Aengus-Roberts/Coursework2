# Coursework2
2nd Coursework for PH20018 programming module focusing on pathfinding and optimisation.

Q1:2 creates random two dimensional grids of a user specified size with n conducting particles of two different types. The code then analyses these grids to see if a path between two conduction bands (edges of the grid) exists. 

Q3 performs a similar task but in 3 dimensions. 

functions.h contains functions shared by both questions such as a RNG list function.
